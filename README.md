# Tourism Indonesia Recommendation System

## Introduction
Indonesia has many beautiful tourism spots, yet these recent years are tough especially to tourism business due to pandemic. Recently the pandemic has calmed down and business starts to run again. But it still needs time to recover.

The project is about to recommend the tourism spots, based on provided dataset. In this case, we are using spots in Java's island. Using several method of data science, perhaps, this project can help us by recommend tourism spots to the users.

The datasets contains several tourist attractions in 5 major cities in Indonesia, namely Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Bandung, Surabaya. This dataset is used in the Capstone Project Bangkit Academy 2021 called GetLoc. GetLoc as an application that is able to recommend several tourist destinations according to the user, what the user likes, and several parameters such as city, price, category, and also time.

The dataset is provided publicly from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aprabowo/indonesia-tourism-destination

## Model Conclusion
There are several models included here, there are : Random Forest Regressor, SVD and KNNBasic. Random Forest Regressor is a technique which works in regression, while SVD and KNNBasic are techniques which usually used in recommender system.

- Random Forest : Combination of Decision Tree which combined into a single model. This tmodel is known for it's ability to handle more robust data as well.

- SVD : A technique to decompose data matrix with any size, and this technique usually used for recommendation system.

- KNNBasic : A technique that used widely to define recommendation model system

The recommendation system has SVD model as it's best available recommendation system model.

## Disclaimer
**This project is made by a non-expert in this field. In this project, we are trying to achieve a model which help us to determine air condition from some basic understanding of data science perspective.**
